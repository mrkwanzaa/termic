// The agent-working spinner: a model is generating RIGHT NOW. Its quiet
// counterpart is `BackgroundRing`, for an agent that has stopped and is
// waiting on something it delegated.
//
// SVG, and a 2px stroke, and both are corrections to the CSS version this
// replaces. That one was a `border-radius` ring with a `border-[1.5px]`:
// 1.5px is exactly 3 device pixels at 2x and lands on a HALF pixel at 1x, so
// the same mark came out crisp on a retina display and thin and smeared on
// anything else. 2px is whole-pixel at both. Reported as the indicator being
// thicker on retina, which it was.
//
// Two circles, not a three-quarter arc. The old one hid a quarter of the
// ring by making `border-top` transparent, which reads as a ring with a bite
// out of it; a faint full track under a brighter arc reads as one object
// with a highlight travelling round it. Same information, and it no longer
// looks broken when it stops.
//
// Both circles are drawn from `currentColor`, so a caller sets the colour
// once and the track follows it. No hex anywhere: themes override the token.
//
// Keep `size` EVEN. An odd box centres on a half pixel by definition, which
// is the wobble the CSS version documented and this one inherits: the
// rotation is about the box centre either way.
