// Renders every task the user has visited this session, keeping all
// of them mounted with display toggles. This is critical:
//
//   * Each TaskView owns xterm.js instances + live PTYs.
//   * Unmounting kills the PTY → agent process dies → session lost.
//   * So we keep them mounted; only the active one is displayed.
//
// Hidden tasks MUST be `display: none`, not `visibility: hidden`: xterm's
// renderer only pauses for zero-geometry hosts (its IntersectionObserver
// keys on geometry, not visibility), so a visibility-hidden terminal whose
// agent TUI keeps redrawing (spinners, prompt cursors) still runs WebGL
// draws + compositor work for every mounted task, around the clock. That
// pinned the GPU (~90% busy) and burned ~0.5 core of webview CPU even
// with the app "idle". Same pattern as the collapsed bottom split in
// TaskView. display:none also blurs the hidden pane's textarea, which
// pauses xterm's cursor-blink loop for free.
//
// First-time activation lazily appends the task to the mounted set
// (handled in `setActiveTask`). Archived tasks are excluded so
// their PTYs are freed.
