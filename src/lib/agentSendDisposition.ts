// for. An agent that has delegated work is NOT mid-turn: its own loop has
// stopped while subagents or shells it started keep running, so there is no
// turn left to wait for and no work-done edge coming to drain the queue on.
// A message that queues there can sit forever, which is what "5 queued" behind
// an agent waiting on two others looks like.
//
// Pure, because the rule is four flags and the failure mode is a deadlock
// nobody sees until an agent has been silent for ten minutes.
