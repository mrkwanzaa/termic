// Following the user's unsubmitted draft from their own keystrokes.
//
// While the user has text in an agent's prompt, nothing automatic may type
// there: it would land inside their text and the Enter that follows would send
// both as one message. So a queued message, and a prompt another agent sends
// over the CLI or MCP, waits while `composing` is true (TerminalPane,
// agentSendDisposition).
//
// That makes a WRONG "composing" a deadlock, and a silent one: every message
// for the tab queues, the turn-end drain refuses to send, the stall watchdog
// stands down, and nothing clears it until someone presses Enter in that
// terminal. An agent only other agents talk to never gets that Enter. The
// tracker was a character count, and three ordinary things left it above zero
// with an empty prompt:
//
//   - answering a blocking prompt. claude's permission dialog takes a bare
//     digit, no Enter: one counted character, never submitted, never cleared;
//   - deleting a word (Ctrl-W, Option-Backspace), which removed the text and
//     none of the count;
//   - recalling history with Up and stepping back out with Down.
//
// So this tracks the text itself, as far as keystrokes can say, and takes the
// one fact a keystroke cannot: whether the agent is blocked on a prompt of its
// own, in which case the key is an answer and not a draft.
//
// Still an estimate. The cursor is assumed to be at the end, and an edit this
// cannot see (a click, a kill-line, an agent that clears its own input) is not
// modelled. It errs towards "there is a draft", because typing into a real one
// is the worse mistake; the cases above are the ones where it erred that way
// with nothing there at all.
