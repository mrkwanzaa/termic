// How a task is named in the UI (GH #260).
//
// A task keeps whatever title was typed at creation. That is right for a task
// finished the same day, but one that sits for a week next to a dozen others
// is remembered by its branch: that is the name on the PR, in `git log` and in
// every conversation about the work. The `useBranchAsTaskName` pref (Settings
// -> Tasks, off by default) swaps the label for the branch wherever a task is
// named, and this is the single place that decides it.
//
// Worktree tasks only (see `identifyingBranch`). The branch read here is the
// one frozen on the task record at creation, the same value the breadcrumb has
// always shown. Checking out a different branch inside the worktree does not
// rewrite it, and resolving live HEAD instead would mean a git call per sidebar
// row on every render.
