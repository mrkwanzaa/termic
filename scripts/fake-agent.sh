# Fixture "agent CLI" for e2e runs (see .claude/skills/e2e + docs/e2e-tests.md).
# Registered in the scratch profile so tasks spawn / resume / queue against a
# real PTY with ZERO tokens.
#
# Built to behave like `claude` so termic's agent-state UI (working indicator,
# attention badge, notifications) is exercised realistically:
#   - long-lived interactive PTY: stays alive until signalled, like a TUI.
#   - drives the OSC terminal title with claude's status glyphs — `✳` when
#     idle (work done), a Braille spinner while working. termic classifies
#     these exactly as it classifies real claude (see BUILTIN_TITLE_SIGNALS
#     `claude` in src/lib/agents.ts). The `fakeagent` registry entry must carry
#     the same `capabilities.signals` for the classifier to fire (the e2e
#     profile seeds them — keep the two in lock-step).
#   - one busy -> idle cycle per submitted line, mirroring "type a prompt, it
#     works, it goes idle".
#   - echoes its argv so a test can assert resume flags (--session-id/--resume,
#     --name) reached the spawn, and records it to e2e-agent-argv.log, which
#     is the only place a spec can read it (terminal output is a canvas).
#   - with TERMIC_FAKE_SESSION_ID set, reports that id over termic's hook OSC
#     on the FIRST prompt: codex's shape, where the session is created lazily.

#               "Waiting for N background agents to finish" status line and go
#               to the IDLE glyph while the work is still outstanding. Every
#               byte-stream signal then says "finished" and only that line says
#               otherwise, which is the whole point.
#   #settle     clear the pending line (the work landed) and go idle for real.
#   #stage      a multi-stage turn whose FIRST stage looks finished: idle glyph,
#               quiet PTY, still screen, so termic calls the turn done. Then the
#               agent goes back to work long after that done and finishes for
#               real. Both halves have to survive: the spinner has to come back
#               (a done we got wrong must not outlive the evidence), and the
#               real completion still has to fire (the turn's done token was
#               spent on the wrong one). The sleep is long enough to clear
#               STICKY_DONE_MS counted from when the done actually fires, not
#               from when the stage ends.
#   #hookstage  the same two-stage turn as #stage, but reported over the HOOK
#               transport (OSC 133;C/;D) rather than the title. A 133;D
#               reaches fireDone with `fromHook`, which bypasses the
#               one-done-per-submit token, so this is the path #stage cannot
#               cover. Real claude with shell integration emits this shape all
#               day (GH #276).
#   #osc9 TEXT  emit an OSC 9 notification with a verbatim body, the way claude
#               asks for the user. BEL-terminated, as claude sends it.
#   #usage BODY replay what claude's termic STATUS LINE writes: an OSC 777
#               carrying subscription usage (GH #277). BODY is everything after
#               the trusted `termic;` sender, e.g. `usage 58 41 - -`. Real
#               claude sends this on every turn from the script
#               agent_hooks::statusline_body generates; the wire format is
#               pinned in lib/agentUsage.ts. It must NEVER badge the tab, which
#               is the half a spec has to prove.
#   #delegated BODY
#               a hook turn whose done found work OUTSTANDING: 133;C, then the
#               DELEGATED report instead of a 133;D, which is what claude's
#               generated done script writes when its `Stop` payload still
#               holds a subagent or a backgrounded shell. BODY is everything
#               after the `agent delegated: ` prefix, e.g. `1 shell b1`. The
#               grammar is pinned in lib/delegatedWork.ts and produced by
#               agent_hooks.rs; send the same BODY twice to replay the case
#               where the same work is still outstanding a turn later.
#   #hookdone   a plain hook turn that ENDS: 133;C then 133;D, nothing
#               outstanding. What claude writes when its `Stop` payload has an
#               empty `background_tasks`, and the only one of these that rings.
#   #bel        emit a REAL bell, distinct from the BEL that terminates an OSC.
#   #iip        emit an inline PNG, then Pi's alternate-screen redraw.
#   #hookattn   reproduce a claude PERMISSION PROMPT with termic's agent hook
#               installed. Real claude paints its IDLE glyph while it is
#               blocked on you (measured), which arms termic's 5s settle and
#               fires a false "done"; the hook's OSC 777 lands ~20ms later and
#               cancels it. This directive replays that exact order, so the
#               spec proves the attention wins the race rather than trusting
#               that it does. Body must match agentHooks.ts HOOK_OSC_BODY.
