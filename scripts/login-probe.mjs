// Does each agent's login STILL follow the variable we think it does?
//
// The account switcher (GH #278) rests on one table: `agent_dirs::login_store`
// says which environment variable relocates each agent's credential. That
// table is a set of MEASUREMENTS of other people's software, so it goes stale
// silently when an agent ships a change: the switcher keeps "working", every
// unit test keeps passing, and two accounts quietly share one login.
//
// This is the check that catches it. For each installed agent it points the
// measured variable at an EMPTY directory and asserts the CLI reports itself
// signed out. A CLI that still answers is one whose login no longer follows
// that variable.
//
// Local only, never CI, exactly like `make lsp-smoke`: it needs the real CLIs
// installed and really logged in, which no runner has. Run it when an agent
// updates, or when the switcher starts behaving oddly for one agent.
//
// NOTHING HERE READS A CREDENTIAL. It only observes whether the agent thinks
// it has one.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. An agent that keeps its token in an OS keyring under a
// FIXED service name will report itself signed out when its config dir moves
// (its settings went with it) while the credential stays shared. "It said
// signed out" is therefore necessary but not sufficient. That is why copilot
// and muse are listed with no check rather than a passing one, and why gemini
// is probed WITH the companion variable that pins it to file storage.
