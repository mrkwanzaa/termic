//! Subscription usage: how much of an account's rolling limits is spent
//! (GH #277).
//!
//! Two providers, two transports, and they are different on purpose.
//!
//! **claude** reports itself. Claude Code pipes `rate_limits` into the
//! statusLine command's stdin on every turn, so `agent_hooks::statusline_body`
//! installs a script that forwards it over the OSC channel the hooks already
//! use. Nothing in this module is involved: the numbers arrive at the terminal.
//!
//! **codex** is asked. It exposes `account/rateLimits/read` as a documented
//! JSON-RPC method on `codex app-server`, which answers COLD, with no agent
//! running and no session in flight, and returns the account id alongside the
//! numbers. That is strictly better than the alternative (tailing the
//! `token_count` event out of its rollout JSONL): no file walking, no parsing,
//! and no dependence on `session_meta.cwd`, which inside Docker is the path as
//! the CONTAINER sees it and cannot be matched against a host worktree.
//!
//! Both are per-account for the same reason: a cloned agent relocates its whole
//! config dir with the agent's own env var (`CODEX_HOME` here), so the config
//! dir IS the account. This module never has to know what an account is; it
//! points codex at a directory and believes what comes back.
//!
//! See docs/ideas/usage-footer.md for the sources that were measured and
//! rejected, which is most of them.
