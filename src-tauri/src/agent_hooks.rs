//! Agent lifecycle hooks: one hook, installed into Claude's own config, that
//! tells termic the moment the agent is blocked on the user.
//!
//! Why this exists: Claude paints its IDLE glyph while it is waiting on a
//! permission prompt, a question, or plan approval. termic reads that title,
//! arms its 5s settle, and fires a "done" badge about a second before the
//! native OSC 9 notify (6.0s late) corrects it to "needs you". Measured; see
//! `docs/agent-hooks.md`.
//!
//! The transport is deliberately not IPC. A Claude hook's stdout JSON may carry
//! a `terminalSequence`, which Claude writes to its own PTY, and `TerminalPane`
//! already parses OSC 777 into `goAttention` (which calls `cancelSettle`, and
//! that is what kills the false done). So there is no socket, no callback
//! binary, no Seatbelt grant and no Docker plumbing: the channel is the terminal
//! the agent already owns, and it behaves identically caged and uncaged.
//!
//! Two things here are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:
//!
//! 1. The script lives in the agent's OWN config dir, never the termic data
//!    dir. Seatbelt denies the data dir read AND write, and `$HOME/.config` is
//!    not in `sandbox::system_read_roots()`, so a caged agent could exec a
//!    script in neither. `~/.claude` is already readable in the cage.
//! 2. The script bails unless `TERMIC_TASK_ID` is set and `GROK_HOOK_EVENT` is
//!    not. The install is GLOBAL, so without the first gate we would write OSC
//!    into every terminal the user runs claude in; and Grok reads
//!    `~/.claude/settings.json` too (measured), so without the second we would
//!    silently change an agent the user never opted in for.

/// Bump when the script body or the settings entry shape changes. Recorded in
/// the manifest so a later version knows an older install is stale and replaces
/// it rather than appending a second entry.
// v2 registered a Working HEARTBEAT (claude/grok PreToolUse, an opencode
// throttle). An install from v1 still works and reports less, so it is stale
// rather than broken.
// v3 writes to the first of three targets that accepts it, so a Docker
// sandboxed agent can reach the terminal at all: $TERMIC_PTY is a HOST path and
// does not exist in the container, which made every hook in a sandboxed tab a
// silent no-op. A v2 install is not stale-but-working there, it is dead, which
// is the strongest reason yet for sync to update installs on its own.
// v4 registers claude's `SessionStart` as `Signal::Ready`. Without it the only
// evidence that an agent can accept typed input is that its terminal painted
// and went quiet, and a blocking startup dialog does exactly that: termic typed
// its first message into claude's "do you trust this folder?" picker and the
// submit landed on the highlighted default, `No, exit`. A v3 install types into
// the dialog exactly as before, so this is stale-and-harmful, not stale-and-
// quieter. See `Signal::Ready`.
// v5 turns claude's Done guard from "is anything in flight" into a whitelist of
// task types. v4 asked the wrong question: an artifact watch is an ambient
// websocket monitor that stays `running` for the whole session, so one publish
// made every later `Stop` look like outstanding work and the tab span forever
// with no demoter left to correct it. A v4 install is not stale-and-quieter, it
// is a tab that never stops loading, which is the same severity as v3 in Docker.
// v6 changes two script BODIES, which an upgrade alone would not pick up: an
// install writes the scripts once and nothing rewrites them afterwards, so a v5
// install keeps reporting exactly what v5 reported. Both changes matter enough
// to be worth a reinstall. claude's and codex's ATTENTION scripts now read
// `tool_name` out of the payload, so the banner names the tool it is blocked on
// rather than saying "agent needs your input"; and codex's READY script now also
// reports the session id, which is the only way a repo-root codex task can
// resume its OWN conversation instead of whichever one ran last in that
// directory.
// v7 adds claude's usage STATUS LINE (GH #277), which is not a hook and is not
// in `hooks_for`: it is a second file in the same script dir plus a `statusLine`
// entry in the same config. A v6 install has neither, and nothing but a
// reinstall would write them, so the bump is the only thing that gets the
// footer its numbers on an existing setup. Unlike every bump above this one is
// stale-and-quieter rather than stale-and-harmful: a v6 install keeps reporting
// state correctly and shows no usage.
//
// v10 has claude's READY script report the session id after `/clear`,
// `/resume` and `/compact` (GH #306). Each of those is a `SessionStart` in the
// same process, and `/clear` and `/resume` move the conversation to another
// session id that termic never heard about, so a relaunch resumed the session
// from before the `/clear`. Stale-and-harmful: a v9 install keeps resuming the
// wrong conversation.
//
// Safe to bump for an existing codex install: the trust entries in config.toml
// hash the hooks.json ENTRY (command path, timeout, status message), none of
// which this changes, so a reinstall re-asks codex and writes back the same
// hashes rather than orphaning them.
//
// v11 has claude's status line also report the CONTEXT WINDOW, on its own
// `ctx` body. Stale-and-quieter: a v10 install reports usage exactly as before
// and simply shows no context.
//
// v12 filters grok's `Notification` to `permission_prompt` (its idle nag rang
// the bell after every turn) and has agy report its conversation id.
// Stale-and-harmful for grok: a v11 install keeps ringing.
//
// v13 moves working/done off raw OSC 133 onto termic's own trusted bodies
// (`WORKING_BODY` / `DONE_BODY`), so an agent's own 133 marks can be ignored,
// and ends an opencode turn on its final message rather than `session.idle`.
// Stale-and-harmful: a v12 install's 133 is now ignored for hooked agents.
//
// v14 bounds every terminal write (`bound_emits`): a hook blocked writing to a
// dead tab's pty held the tty lock and hung every new claude. Stale-and-
// harmful: a v13 install can still wedge.
// v15 makes a HELD done speak. Every done guard that withholds (claude's
// `background_tasks`, grok's `backgroundTasks`, agy's `fullyIdle`) used to
// `exit 0` writing nothing, which is byte-for-byte what a model mid-token
// writes; it now reports `agent delegated: <count> <label> <ids>`. Stale-and-
// harmful: a v14 install keeps the silent script, so a tab whose agent left a
// shell running spins until the 20-minute ceiling and every later turn in
// that session is swallowed too. That is the whole bug, so an install that
// does not re-sync does not get the fix.

// write: "only OSC 0/1/2/9/99/777 and BEL are permitted, and OSC 9 bodies may
// not begin with a digit unless in the 9;4 progress form", quoted from the
// binary. OSC 133 is not on that list, so a `Done` sent that way is dropped
// SILENTLY: the hook fires correctly and nothing reaches the parser. Measured.
//
// Staying on `9;4` instead would be allowed but costs the hard done: `9;4;0`
// routes through the 5s settle, while `133;D` is `goIdle(reason, 0)`. For the
// two states that matter most that is the wrong trade, so claude joins
// everyone else on the pty.

// The pty path works for every agent because opening a tty BY NAME needs no

    // A Done hook must NOT claim the turn is over while the agent still has
    // work outstanding. claude fires `Stop` with a populated `background_tasks`
    // when it backgrounds a subagent or a shell and keeps waiting (measured),
    // and agy reports the same thing as `fullyIdle: false`. termic used to
    // catch this by scanning the SCREEN for the agent's own status line, which
    // is the kind of text heuristic hooks exist to replace: this reads the
    // protocol instead.
    //
    // The guard is a WHITELIST of task types, and it has to be, because
    // "non-empty" was measured to mean things that never end. Read out of
    // 2.1.259: the Stop payload is built by mapping the whole task registry
    // through one filter, `status is running|pending && isBackgrounded !==
    // false`. Nothing else is dropped, and the switch that decorates the
    // entries has an explicit arm for `monitor_ws` - a websocket monitor.
    // Publishing an artifact opens one (the live-updates subscription) and it
    // stays `running` for the whole session, so from the first publish onward
    // EVERY `Stop` carried a non-empty array and this guard dropped every one
    // of them. claude's own task list hides exactly these
    // (`if (t.type === "monitor_ws" && t.ambient) continue`); the hook payload
    // does not, so termic has to.
    //
    // So the question is not "is anything in flight" but "is the AGENT still
    // working", and only delegated units of work answer yes. The friendly
    // labels come from claude's own type map: local_agent -> subagent,
    // local_workflow -> workflow, local_bash -> shell, in_process_teammate ->
    // teammate, remote_agent -> cloud session, mcp_task -> MCP task. Ambient
    // monitors (monitor_ws / monitor_mcp), `dream` and `auto-mode scan` are
    // deliberately absent, and so is any type a future release adds: an
    // unknown type falls through to done.
    //
    // Fail towards done, not towards working. Once hooks own a tab there is no
    // demoter left to correct a done that never arrives, so a wrong hold is
    // permanent; a wrong done is re-armed by the very next `PreToolUse`
    // heartbeat. The asymmetry runs the opposite way to the fallback path's.
    //
    // Deliberately no `jq`: whitespace is stripped and the field matched
    // literally, so the script keeps its "no dependencies" property. An absent
    // field means an older agent that cannot background work, so done stands.
    // The array is sliced out before matching rather than matched across the
    // whole payload, because `last_assistant_message` carries the agent's own
    // prose and a turn that happened to discuss `"type":"shell"` would
    // otherwise hold its own spinner down forever. `##` (longest prefix) picks
    // the LAST occurrence, which is the real field: claude serialises
    // `last_assistant_message` before `background_tasks`.
