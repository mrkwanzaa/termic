//! Single source of truth for "where does this agent's persistent state
//! actually live". Two very different consumers used to hand-maintain
//! their own copy of this and could silently drift apart:
//!
//! - Seatbelt's default `Agent.sandbox_allowed_paths` (`lib.rs`'s
//!   `default_agents()`) — real `$HOME` paths on the host, allow-listed
//!   for `sandbox-exec` to read/write directly.
//! - Docker's per-agent config-dir mount (`docker.rs`'s `agent_config()`)
//!   — container `/root` paths, bind-mounted from a termic-owned host dir
//!   that is never the host's real `$HOME`.
//!
//! Docker only wants the CONFIRMED state dirs (login, sessions, MCP
//! config — the ones `docs/docker-sandbox/findings.md` actually
//! verified hold real state): it mounts a termic-owned dir, not the real
//! `$HOME`, so persisting a cache dir there buys nothing. Seatbelt allows
//! these same dirs, PLUS its own macOS-only extras (XDG-style
//! `.config`/`.local/share` paths some agents may or may not ever use,
//! `Library/Application Support/*`, regex-covered sidecar files like
//! claude's `.claude.json`) that have no Docker-container equivalent and
//! stay hand-authored in `default_agents()`.
//!
//! Keeping the CONFIRMED subset here means a renamed or added state dir
//! is a one-line change in one place, not two files quietly falling out
//! of sync.

/// One agent's confirmed state dirs, relative to its home (`$HOME` on the
/// host, `/root` inside the Docker image — both conventions land on the
/// same relative subpath). Order matters for an agent with no config-dir
/// relocation env var: the FIRST entry is Docker's primary mount, every
/// entry after it is an `extra_dirs` mount alongside it.
/// Where THIS agent INSTANCE keeps its config on the host.
///
/// One resolver rather than a per-agent abstraction, deliberately. The pieces
/// are already data (`state_dirs`, `config_relocation_env`, and the hook
/// installer's `settings_rel`), and the only thing missing was somewhere that
/// composes them for a specific agent entry rather than for a built-in NAME.
/// A trait or a module per agent would buy no control that these tables do not
/// already give, and would turn "add an agent" from adding a row into
/// implementing an interface.
///
/// Three cases, most specific first:
///   1. the entry relocates its whole config with the agent's own env var
///      (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.next-claude`), which is how a clone holds a
///      SECOND account. That path is the config dir, verbatim.
///   2. the entry overrides `HOME`, so the default dir hangs off that instead.
///   3. neither: the base's default dir under the real home.
///
/// Returns None only when the base agent has no known state dir at all, which
/// is the honest answer for an agent nobody has mapped.
